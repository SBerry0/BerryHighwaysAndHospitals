I think I have to split the problem up into multiple smaller parts of the same thing by focusing on all groups of cities that are connected to each other, but I don't know yet how to create the clusters. |
| Sep 11 | 8:15-9:00pm | I realized I could use BFS to find clusters because it would go through all possible combinations if I didn't provide an end case like if it's at the end square. I now have an arraylist that holds and arraylist of cities, each of which represent cities and their clusters. I tested it on the first two test cases of testCorrectSmall and it was correct so I feel confident about that. Now I have to figure out what to do with these clusters to get the cost of the highways and hospitals. I'm thinking of something along the lines of trying to figure out which city has the most neighbors and go from there. |
