| Sep 10 |  1:45-2:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I wasn't really sure how to approach the code, so I wanted to work on making the data that we're given usable by making classes for each city to tell if it has a hospital in it and if what connections it could have. I think I have to split the problem up into multiple smaller parts of the same thing by focusing on all groups of cities that are connected to each other, but I don't know yet how to create the clusters. |
| Sep 11 |  8:15-9:00pm  |                                                                       I realized I could use BFS to find clusters because it would go through all possible combinations if I didn't provide an end case like if it's at the end square. I now have an arraylist that holds and arraylist of cities, each of which represent cities and their clusters. I tested it on the first two test cases of testCorrectSmall and it was correct so I feel confident about that. Now I have to figure out what to do with these clusters to get the cost of the highways and hospitals. I'm thinking of something along the lines of trying to figure out which city has the most neighbors and go from there. |
| Sep 11 | 9:00-10:00pm  |                                             I created a king of the hill thing to check for the city in the cluster with the most neighbors, then added a hospital to that one and a highway to all of its possible connecting cities. If a city has either a highway or a hospital, they are out of play. With that, 3 of the tests are passing, two are wrong, and one times out. I was trying to figure out why the two were wrong but when debugging I couldn't find any. I got sent down a rabbit hole when I compared the clusters I was making to those in the file, but then I realized like 20 mins later that there are multiple tests in each file, so that wasn't actually the problem. |
| Sep 16 | 10:00-10:45am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      I changed the way I calculated the price from the clusters to use the equation we found in class, and that solved the issue of the wrong problem sets. It still timed out on the first test, but when I increased the time limit it passed, so that means I just have to make it faster. To do that, I started on a first version of union find, which doesn't work right now. |
| Sep 17 |  6:45-7:30pm  | I got union find somewhat working, with a few of the tests passing. I got stuck while checking if I was adding a circular loop into the map which would cause it to miscount the number of clusters. I finally figured out that I could check if what was in the root of what I was adding was the same thing and that solved the loop issue. Then I had to check if the number of clusters was over 1 because sometimes it would fill the map and the clusters would be assumed to be 0, which isn't possible. Now, it's a matter of efficiency because it isn't not passing the large tests, it's just taking a really long time to run. I have no clue where to make it faster right now though. |
