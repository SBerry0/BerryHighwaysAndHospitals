| Sep 10 | 1:45-2:30 | I wasn't really sure how to approach the code, so I wanted to work on making the data that we're given usable by making classes for each city to tell if it has a hospital in it and if what connections it could have. I think I have to split the problem up into multiple smaller parts of the same thing by focusing on all groups of cities that are connected to each other, but I don't know yet how to create the clusters. |
